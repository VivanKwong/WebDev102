## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
This challenge wasn't too bad! I based it off of our lab, which helped a lot. The main challenges came from the errors
in the lab for steps 4, 5, and 6, but they were manageable with the posts on Slack, and the description of the error
messages in the terminal. A major challenge was figuring out how to commit my code. On VSCode, it said that there were
10000+ pending changes. It was too much for my computer and Github to handle. Also, it appeared as a subrepository, and
I didn't know how to access the files even once I managed to push my changes to Github. As a solution, I only uploaded
my src folder for the project. It has all the code I worked on, and is small enough to be processed by Github.
