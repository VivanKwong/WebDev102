## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I was confused during the lab about props, which also meant I was confused as I started doing this project. To learn more about how to
implement props, I did some research online. Another challenge I faced was formatting. I had to resize the images and the cards so that they would look uniform, and I had to play around with the CSS until I was satisfied. Another thing I struggled with is that I wanted to change 
the background color. Unfortunately, I couldn't get rid of this one white spot and I did not know where it was coming from, so I kept the
background white.
