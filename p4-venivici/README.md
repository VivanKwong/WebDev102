## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Formatting so that the item is displayed on the left side and the ban list is on the right side. 
Some of the images wouldn't render.
Formatting so that the images were the same size. 
Making it so that the user can remove items from the ban list if they would like.
Overall, most of my challenges were with CSS.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
